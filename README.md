# APHWs
I have this repo for my codes to do the Advanced Programming homeworks stuff easier.

**APHW.py** extracts each submission and separates files and tells if each student has improper filename or has some missing files.

It's just enough to call ```extractHW(hw_zipfile)``` with *hw_zipfile* being the submission zipfiles.
